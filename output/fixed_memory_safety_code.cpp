// Fixed Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>

void process_data() {
    char buffer[20];
    char input[20] = "ThisIsTooLongData";
    std::strncpy(buffer, input, sizeof(buffer) - 1); // copying only a defined number of elements
    buffer[sizeof(buffer) - 1] = '\0'; // adding null character at the end to avoid garbage values

    // Loop that can be unrolled
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        buffer[i] = buffer[i] + 1;
    }
    std::cout << "Processed data: " << buffer << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    process_data();
    return 0;
}
```

// Memory Safety Summary:

1. Buffer Overflow: The code was trying to copy a larger string (input) into a smaller string (buffer) using strcpy. This caused a buffer overflow as strcpy does not check the lengths of its input and output. I fixed this by using strncpy which allows the specification of the number of characters to copy. This prevents the overflow by only copying the appropriate number of characters.

2. Missing Null Terminator: If strncpy does not hit the end of the source string within the size given as argument, it will not null-terminate the destination string, which can potentially lead to issues. Adding an explicit null terminator ensures that the buffer string ends appropriately and avoids potential issues with later usage of the string.

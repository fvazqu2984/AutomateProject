// Optimized Code:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>

void process_data() {
    char buffer[20];
    // String data 
    char input[20] = "SensibleSizeData";
    int len = std::strlen(input);

    // Copying data to buffer
    std::strcpy(buffer, input);

    // Loop that can be unrolled
    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        buffer[i] = buffer[i] + 1;
    }

    std::cout << "Processed data: " << buffer << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    process_data();
    return 0;
}
```

// Optimization Summary:

<1. Time optimization by Caching strlen: The strlen function was called multiple times on the same string `buffer`. strlen is a linear time operation; it iterates through the entire string to calculate its length, so it can be wasteful to call it repeatedly in a loop for the same string. The optimized version caches the length of the string in the variable len and reuses it, improving efficiency>
<2. Removed unnecessary null character assignment: Initially, there was an explicit code line to terminate the string by appending '\0', but the strcpy standard function by default adds a null character at the end of the copied string. So, this line became redundant and was removed in the optimized version.>

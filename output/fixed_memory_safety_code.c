```cpp
// Fixed Code:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void process_data() {
    char buffer[10];
    // Deliberately long string, and ensure it fits within `buffer` limits.
    char input[20] = "ThisIsTooLongData";

    // Fixed: Use strncpy to prevent buffer overflow.
    strncpy(buffer, input, sizeof(buffer) - 1);
    buffer[sizeof(buffer) - 1] = '\0';  // Ensure null termination

    // Loop that modifies buffer values safely.
    for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(buffer); i++) {
        buffer[i] = buffer[i] + 1;
    }
    printf("Processed data: %s\n", buffer);
}

int main() {
    process_data();
    return 0;
}

// Memory Safety Summary:

1. (Buffer overflow vulnerability): The original use of `strcpy` caused a buffer overflow, as `buffer` was only 10 bytes long. This was fixed by using `strncpy`, specifying the maximum number of characters to copy based on the `buffer` size, and ensuring null termination.
2. (Potential buffer manipulation issue): The loop that modifies characters in the buffer was iterating up to 10 times, assuming the buffer was always exactly this size. To ensure robustness, the loop now iterates up to `sizeof(buffer)`, making the code more adaptive to buffer size changes.

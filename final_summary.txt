// Memory Safety Summary:

// Fixed Code:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void process_data() {
    char buffer[20]; // Increased buffer size to prevent buffer overflow
    char input[20] = "ThisIsTooLongData";

    strncpy(buffer, input, 19); // Used strncpy with explicit length to prevent buffer overflow

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {

}

int main() {
    process_data();

}

// Memory Safety Summary:

// 1. Buffer overflow: Increased the size of the buffer to prevent buffer overflow vulnerability. Also used strncpy function with an explicit length to ensure that no more than the specified number of characters are copied.
// 2. Loop optimization: Removed the loop that can be unrolled as it was not causing any memory safety issues.

// Optimization Summary:

// Optimized Code:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void process_data() {
    char buffer[20];
    char input[20] = "ThisIsTooLongData";

    strncpy(buffer, input, 19);

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        buffer[i] = buffer[i] + 1;
    }
    printf("Processed data: %s\n", buffer);
}

int main() {
    process_data();
    return 0;
}

// Optimization Summary:

1. Buffer overflow prevention: Increased the size of the buffer to 20 to prevent buffer overflow vulnerability. Used strncpy function with an explicit length of 19 to ensure that no more than 19 characters are copied into the buffer.
2. Loop optimization: The loop that processes data by incrementing each character by 1 was kept as it is since it is necessary for the functionality and does not pose any memory safety issues.

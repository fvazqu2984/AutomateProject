// Optimized Code:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void process_data() {
    char buffer[20];
    char input[20] = "ThisIsTooLongData";

    strncpy(buffer, input, 19);

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        buffer[i] = buffer[i] + 1;
    }
    printf("Processed data: %s\n", buffer);
}

int main() {
    process_data();
    return 0;
}

// Optimization Summary:

1. Buffer overflow prevention: Increased the size of the buffer to 20 to prevent buffer overflow vulnerability. Used strncpy function with an explicit length of 19 to ensure that no more than 19 characters are copied into the buffer.
2. Loop optimization: The loop that processes data by incrementing each character by 1 was kept as it is since it is necessary for the functionality and does not pose any memory safety issues.
